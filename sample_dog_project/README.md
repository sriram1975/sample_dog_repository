# Assessment (max 5 hours)
Introduction
-
This assessment consists of **3** tests.

Each test focuses on different aspects of a developer's daily work in our department:
 * How to deal with SQL
 * How to integrate DBs in our applications
 * How to read from files
 * How to create REST APIs
 * How to validate inputs
 * etc.

In each test some files, some structures and some suggestions are already in place.

Java 11 and JUnit5 must be used and JPMS (java modules) is a big plus if properly used. Module descriptions are already in place in order to facilitate the tests.
